              Hi, Iâ€™m Poushil Dhali, a passionate and hardworking Computer Science and Engineering graduate (B.Tech, WBUT) from Kolkata, West Bengal. Iâ€™m someone who finds joy in solving problems, creating meaningful digital experiences, and constantly learning new things.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in web development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, SQL, and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve also explored programming with Java, Python, and C, which gave me a deeper understanding of logic building and software development. Through my projects â€” like a real-time News Feed app, a Movie Recommendation platform, a Weather App, and even a Video Calling tool â€” Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in building responsive, user-friendly applications that bring ideas to life.

Iâ€™ve also strengthened my knowledge with certifications such as JAVA J2EE (Wipro, 2024), HTML, CSS & JavaScript for Web Developers (Coursera, 2022), and 3D CAD Fundamentals (Coursera, 2022).

Beyond technology, I have a curiosity for AI/ML and Blockchain (Web3) â€” two areas I believe will shape the future. Iâ€™m also a JLPT N5 certified Japanese language learner, which reflects my love for exploring cultures and languages.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me playing football or chess, reading novels, or creating melodies on my piano and guitar ðŸŽ¶. These hobbies keep me creative, balanced, and always inspired.

For me, being a software engineer isnâ€™t just about code â€” itâ€™s about innovation, impact, and connection. My dream is to build solutions that not only work but also bring smiles to peopleâ€™s lives.
